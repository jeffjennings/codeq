# codeq
 A collection of my solutions to simple, disparate coding questions from a mix of sources including [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/). I try to implement each solution in both Python and C++. 

 As a quick reminder, on a Mac compile and execute C++ code with 
 `g++ <source_code>.cpp -o <output, no suffix>`
`./<output, no suffix>`
